== Installation ==

There are two methods to install the plug-in:

**Copy the file to the WordPress plug-ins directory:**

1. Make a new directory in [SITE_ROOT]/wp-content/wooe-safe2pay-payment-gateway
2. Copy the files woocommerce-safe2pay.php and woocommerce-safe2pay-gateway.php to this new directory.
3. Activate the newly installed plug-in in the WordPress Plugin Manager.


**Install the plug-in from WordPress:**

1. Search for the WooCommerce Safe2Pay Payment Gateway plug-in from the WordPress Plugin Manager.
2. Install the plug-in.
3. Activate the newly installed plug-in.

== Configuration ==

1. Visit the WooCommerce settings page, and click on the Payment Gateways tab.
2. Click on Safe2Pay to edit the settings. If you do not see Safe2Pay in the list at the top of the screen make sure you have activated the plug in in the WordPress Plug in Manager.
3. Enable the Payment Method, name it Credit Card (this will show up on the payment page your customer sees) and add in your credentials. Click Save.
4. Optional: Bring confidence to every customer purchase by displaying the Safe2Pay logo on your checkout page. This will let them know that theyâ€™re details are safe and their purchase is secure.

You should now be able to test the purchases via Safe2Pay.

== Screenshots ==
